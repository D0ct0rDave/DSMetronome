Basic Usage:
- This is the Sequencer:
- Every row represents the function of an element of a basic drum kit.
- The first cell of every row contains the drum kit element's name. It's the most bigger cell in the row.
- Below the drum kit elememnt name there is a line representing the main volume of that. You can change it
  by pressing with the stylus on that big cell. The most left you press the less volume this element will have.
  The most rigth on that cell, the most volume.
  
- Every other cell in that row represents wether the instrument at this row will be played or not when the 
  sequencer cursor passes over the cell's column. If it's activated the sound will be played. If it's not 
  activated no sound will be played when cursor is over it's column.
- Press with the stylus on a cell to activate or deactivate it.

// - The sound system add's a 10% of dynamics to the sounds. This means that sound volume of a given drum kit 
// element vary around 10% of main volume. The same applies for panning.

- Metronome:
- Press with the stylus in the digits that represent the current BPMs to change them. Pressing in the units 
  will change the BPMs 1 unit at a time. Pressing on the tenths will chagne the BPMs 10 units at a time. 
  Pressing on the cents...
- Increasing digits is performed by pressing over them with the stylus. Decreasing digits is performed by
holding the L button and pressing over them.
- BPM range is comprissed between 40 and 250 BPMs.
- You can change the time signature also pressing on the numerator of the signature. Works like BPMs. 
Increase by using the stylus, decrease by holding L button and using the stylus.
- Valid Time Signatures are 4/4, 3/4, 2/4 and 1/4.
- You can tap a tempo by pressing the B button for at least 4 times, at the rythm of what ever you want.
Start tapping a tempo produces the metronome to be stoped, in order to avoid confusion / craziness :)

- Press start button to stop / start the metronome function. You always see an icon in the display telling
wether the metronome is active or not. 
- Pressing start, also saves current values and the layout of the sequencer, in order to be restored the 
next time you launch the metronome.
